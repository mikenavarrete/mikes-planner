# Mike's Planner
This is a planner that allows me to plan my day as necessary. It saves any info logged, so I can exit and reaccess the page later. The date on the top updates automatically.
## Instructions
- Open the page at the start of your day
- Type in all events for the day
- Hit the save button next to each event
- Reopen the page throughout the day to access your schedule
- Add new events as necessary
